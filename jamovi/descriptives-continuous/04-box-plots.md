## Box Plots
**Box plots** are a graphical way to show average and spread of data.  They plot key descriptive statistics and join them into a box and whisker shape.

The points that are shown are:
- Minimum
- 25th Percentile
- 50th Percentile (Median)
- 75th Percentile
- Maximum

Points which are considered **outliers** (not fitting with the rest of the data) are often plotted seperately outside of the box plot.  These can be above or below the maximum/minimum.
Sometimes you will also see the **mean** plotted on the box plot.

*  From the jamovi dialog box for descriptives (click on the analysis output if it has disappeared), click on the block called **Plots**.
*  Tick the box for **Box Plot**

The numbers next to the outliers are the row numbers in the jamovi dataset.  So the participants that are in the rows that are shown can be considered outliers.
