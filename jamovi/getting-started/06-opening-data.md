## Opening and Saving Datasets

When working on a dataset, you will want to save your progress and open existing data files.

All of these core functions are located in the main menu, which is accessed by clicking the **button with three horizontal lines (`≡`)** in the top-left corner of the jamovi window. This is often called the 'hamburger menu'.

Inside this menu, you will find common functions that work as you would expect in most software:
*   **Open**
*   **Save**
*   **Save As**

### File Formats

jamovi can open a wide variety of data files. Its own native format has the `.omv` extension, but it can also open data from other programs, such as SPSS, Stata, and Microsoft Excel.

**Important:** If you are opening data from an Excel file, make sure your data is formatted correctly:
1.  The very **first row** of your spreadsheet must contain the variable names.
2.  Each subsequent row must represent a single participant or case.

2.  In jamovi, click the **hamburger menu (`≡`)** in the top-left.
3.  Select **Open**.
4.  Use the **Browse** button to navigate to where you saved the file, select it, and click **Open**.

### The Dataset
  
In this study, researchers wanted to investigate whether stroke patients experienced an improvement in wellbeing, independence, and cognitive and motor function following a course of intervention.
*  Some variables were measured at the start (baseline) of the study: Age, Sex, CVA side, NIHSS, FASTbase, ARATbase, BARTHELbase, GHQ12base.
*  Some were measured at three months follow-up: FAST3month, ARAT3month, BARTHEL3month, GHQ3month.
*  NIHSS categorises patients into 4 groups for stroke severity: 1=mild, 4=very severe
*  The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a measure of upper limb functioning.  It is scored from 0-57, with higher scores indicating better functioning
*  The Barthel Index (BARTHEL) measures a patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living. It is scored from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater functional independence
*  The Frenchay Aphasia Screen Test (FAST) assesses whether patients may have a language deficit.  It is scored from 0-30, with higher scores indicating better performance
*  The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is used to assess patients’ psychological well-being. It was scored from 0-12, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress
