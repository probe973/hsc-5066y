##Normality Checking

You are interested whether the following baseline variables are normally distributed, for left-side CVA and right-side CVA participants:
* FAST - `FASTbase`
* ARAT - `ARATbase`
* Barthel - `Barthelbase`
* GHQ12 - `GHQ12base`

Generate descriptive statistics for these variables, separately for left- and right-side CVA, and draw histograms.

Get the results of the **Shapiro-Wilk** test for each of the 8 normality checks.

</div>

Based on the ***p*-value of the Shapiro-Wilk** test, what conclusion would you draw about the normality of the variable by CVA side?
