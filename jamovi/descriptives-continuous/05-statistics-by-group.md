## Statistics by Grouping Variable

Sometimes you may be interested in descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) on a particular measure of different groups.  This may be to explore differences or similarities between the groups.

In this example you are going to generate the descriptive statistics for age again, but this time you are going to look at the values for the different sexes seperately.

</div>

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

*  From the jamovi ribbon, go to **Exploration** then **Descriptives**
*  Place the `Age` variable into the **Variables** box
*  Place the `Sex` variable into the **Split by** box
*  Expand the **Statistics** block and additionally choose **Percentiles**, **Range**, and **IQR**

You should now see each of the statistics split for each of the sexes in the datafile.
