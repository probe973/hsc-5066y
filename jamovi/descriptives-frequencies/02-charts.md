## Bar Charts

A bar chart can be used with categorical data to compare frequencies of different groups to each other.

</div>

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

You are going to get the bar chart from the same part as the frequency table was created.  If you can no longer see this on your screen, click anywhere in the output dialog for the frequencies.  The menu should then appear on the left.

*  Expand the area titled **Plots**
*  Tick the box under **Bar Plots** called **Bar plot**

You should now see bar plots showing the frequencies of the `Sex` and `CVAside` variables.

</div>

## Pie Charts

A pie chart can be used with cateogrical data to compare frequencies of different groups as a proportion of the total.

</div>

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

You are going to use one of the added modules, namely **vijPlots**

*  From the top ribbon click **vijPlots**
*  Choose **Pie Chart** from the **Categorical** section
*  Place `Sex` into the **Variable** box

A pie chart should appear showing the relative proportions of males and females.  You can also explore some of the options below the dialog, for example adding **labels**.



Repeat the process for the `CVAside` variable.
