# Evidence Based Practice 2

Welcome to the interactive resource for HSC-5066Y. This site provides structured guidance and practical exercises to enhance your understanding and application of evidence-based practice, with a focus on data exploration and analysis using jamovi.

Throughout these materials, you will find explanations, step-by-step jamovi instructions, and examples of jamovi output to help you navigate your learning journey. We've also included various question formats to test your understanding as you go along.

We recommend starting with the jamovi guides if you are new to the software, or jumping directly into the modules if you are already familiar with the basics.
