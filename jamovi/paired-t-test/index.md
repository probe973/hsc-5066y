### Which Test Should I Use?

For comparing two repeated measures on the same group, the choice is between the Paired Samples t-test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. The decision depends on the level of data and the normality of the difference scores.

### Comparison of Within-Group Tests

| Level of Measurement of Outcome | Is the Data Normally Distributed? | Test to Use |
|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:------------|
| Continuous (Interval/Ratio)     | Yes                               | **Paired Samples t-test** |
| Continuous (Interval/Ratio)     | No                                | **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** |
