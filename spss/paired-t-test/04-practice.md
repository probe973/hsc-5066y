## Comparing Scores Within Groups over 3 months

Use the correct test to determine whether there is evidence of change from baseline to 3 months on the following measures:

* ARAT
* Barthel

The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is a measure of upper limb functioning. It is scored from 0-57, with higher scores indicating better functioning.

The Barthel Index (BARTHEL) measures a patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living. It is scored from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater functional independence.

Have fun!
