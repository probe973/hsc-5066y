## Adding Additional Modules

jamovi has most common statistical needs addressed by default. However, you can add additional modules created by the community to extend its functionality. We are going to add a couple of powerful chart-drawing modules.

### Installing New Modules

1.  In the top-right of the jamovi window, click the large **plus button (`+`)** to open the Modules menu.
2.  From the menu that appears, select **jamovi library**. A new panel will open showing all available modules.
3.  In the search bar at the top of this panel, type `jj` and look for the module named **jjstatsplot**.
4.  Click the **Install** button below it.
5.  Now, clear the search bar and search for `vij` and look for the module named **vijPlots**.
6.  Again, click the **Install** button below it.
7.  Once both are installed, you can close this menu by clicking the large **up arrow (`â†‘`)** at the top of the panel.

You will now see new icons for `jjstatsplot` and `vijPlots` under the 'Analyses' tab, ready for you to use.
