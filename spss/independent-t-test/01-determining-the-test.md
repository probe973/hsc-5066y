## T-Test vs. Mann-Whitney U Test

The fundamental scenario for both tests is the same: **You have a continuous variable, and you want to know whether two independent groups differ on this variable.**

The choice between them depends entirely on whether the assumptions for the parametric test (the t-test) are met.
</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">
### The Normality Assumption

The primary condition for using the Independent Samples t-test is that the scores on the continuous variable are **normally distributed within both of the two groups**.

*   This assumption is assessed using techniques covered in an earlier guide, such as the **Shapiro-Wilk test**.
*   If the data for both groups are normally distributed, you proceed to the next step (checking variances).
*   If normality cannot be assumed for one or both groups, you **cannot use the t-test** and must use its non-parametric alternative, the **Mann-Whitney U Test**.
</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">
### The Equality of Variances Assumption

The Independent Samples t-test has a further assumption: that the **variances** (a measure of dispersion, calculated as the standard deviation squared) are equal for both groups being compared.

*   This assumption is assessed with a variance test, such as the **Levene's Test** (which we will use in this guide).
*   The Levene's test produces a p-value. If the Levene's test p-value is **greater than 0.05 ($p > .05$)**, the assumption of equal variances is considered **not violated**.
*   If the Levene's test p-value is **less than or equal to 0.05 ($p \le .05$)**, the assumption of equal variances **is violated**.
</div>

### The Decision Path

The assumptions lead to the selection of one of three tests:

1.  **Student's t-test (Standard):** Used when the normality assumption is met AND the equality of variances assumption is NOT violated ($p > .05$ for Levene's test).
2.  **Welch t-test (Adjusted):** Used when the normality assumption is met, but the equality of variances assumption **IS violated** ($p \le .05$ for Levene's test). The Welch test is an adjustment that does not assume equal variances.
3.  **Mann-Whitney U Test (Non-Parametric):** Used when the normality assumption is **NOT met**. This test works by using the **ranks** of each individual's score instead of the score itself and looks for differences in rank position between the groups.
