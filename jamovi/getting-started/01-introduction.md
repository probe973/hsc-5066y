## The jamovi Interface

When opening jamovi you will be presented with something that looks like a standard spreadsheet and an area which contains the jamovi logo. This second area is where all of your statistics and charts will appear.

The spreadsheet part stores your data. It is stored so that every row represents a participant and each column is a different piece of information for the participant, called a variable (e.g. name, age, height, etc.).

As well as entering the data you need to let jamovi know what type of data each variable is.
