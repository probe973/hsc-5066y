    # Evidence Based Practice 2

    <p>Welcome to the interactive resource for HSC-5066Y. This site provides structured guidance and practical exercises to enhance your understanding and application of evidence-based practice, with a focus on data exploration and analysis using jamovi.</p>

    <p>Throughout these materials, you will find explanations, step-by-step jamovi instructions, and examples of jamovi output to help you navigate your learning journey. We've also included various question formats to test your understanding as you go along.</p>

    <p>We recommend starting with the jamovi guides if you are new to the software, or jumping directly into the modules if you are already familiar with the basics.</p>
