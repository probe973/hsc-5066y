## Paired Samples t-test vs. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

Both the Paired Samples t-test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test are used when you have two continuous measures taken from the **same group** of participants (a 'within-groups' or 'repeated measures' design).

The choice between them depends entirely on the assumption of normality.

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">
### The Normality Assumption

The Paired Samples t-test requires that the **difference between the two matched variables are normally distributed**.

*   If the two original variables (e.g., Pre-Intervention and Post-Intervention scores) **are both normally distributed, this is sufficient** for the Paired Samples t-test.

*   If the two original variables **are not normally distributed, this does not necessarily mean** the normality assumption is violated, as the difference between the two variables may still be normally distributed.

*   In SPSS you can compute the difference between the two variables, and then test the normality of this variable

*   If the difference variable **are** normally distributed, you use the **Paired Samples t-test**.
*   If the difference variable **are not** normally distributed, you must use its non-parametric alternative, the **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**.

### The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test is the non-parametric alternative. This test works by using the **ranks** of each individual's score and looks for differences between the groups in rank position.
