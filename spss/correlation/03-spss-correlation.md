## Getting Correlation Coefficients in SPSS

You are going to get *all* of the pairwise correlation coefficients between the interval/ratio variables.

* From the top menu go to **Analyze** → **Correlate** → **Bivariate**
* Place all of the interval/ratio variables (age and the base and 3 month measurements for FAST, ARAT, Barthel, and GHQ) into the **Variables** box.
* As there are a mix of normal and non-normal, check boxes for both **Pearson** and **Spearman** from **Correlation Coefficients**
* Tick the **Flag significant correlations**, the **Show only the lower triangle**
* Untick the **Show diagonal**
* Click **OK**

You should see two tables that you can read off each pair of variables (as each variable appears in both the row and the column).  The first table is the Pearson, the second is the Spearman.

### Age and 3-month FAST score

Both of these variables were normally distributed, so we can use the Pearson's correlation coefficient.  You should find for this pair that there was a non-significant and weak negative correlation.

You may see this result reported like $r(48)=-0.228, p=0.111$

### FAST baseline and 3-month FAST score

The FAST baseline score were not normally distributed, so we can use the Spearman's correlation coefficient. You should find there is a significant and strong positive correlation.

You may see this result reported like $r_s(48)=0.830, p<0.001$

Make some other comparisons between variables, and use you work on creating scatter diagrams to confirm that the correlation coefficient is showing the same thing as the diagram.
