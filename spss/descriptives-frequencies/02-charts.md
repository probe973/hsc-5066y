You are going to get the bar chart from the same menu as the frequency table was created.

*  Go to **Anlayze** then **Descriptive Statistics** and then **Frequencies**
*  The previous setup for `Sex` and `CVASide` should still be there.
*  Click the **Charts**
*  Choose the option next to **Bar Charts**
*  Click **Continue** then click **OK**

You should now see bar plots showing the frequencies of the `Sex` and `CVAside` variables in the **Output** window.
