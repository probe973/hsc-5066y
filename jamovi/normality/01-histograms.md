  ## Histograms
  
  A **histogram** is a chart for continuous variables.  Values for the measure are put into small groups (1 to 5, 5 to 9, etc) and then bars are drawn to show how many people (or whatever the participants represent) belong to that group.
  They are useful in showing the shape of the distribution, shows where the **mode** is (or are if there are more than one) and whether there are any extreme values that may **skew** results.

### Normal Distribution

  A **normally distributed** variable has a *bell like shape*.  It is symmetrical about the **mean** with a sinlge **mode** at the mean.  Due to the symmetry, the **median** is also the mean value.  
  An example of a histogram which could be considered normally distributed is shown below.
