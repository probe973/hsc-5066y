## GHQ12 After 3-month course compared to baseline

The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) is used to assess patients’ psychological well-being. It was scored from 0-12, with higher scores indicating greater psychological distress

You are interested in whether there has been a significant change in GHQ-12 scores after the 3-month course.

Since each participant is measured on two occasions, this is a **paired** type of test.

The **null hypothesis** is there has been no change.

The **research hypothesis** is there has been a change.

If the *p*-value of the test is below a cut-off, 0.05, there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis and say that you have evidence for a difference.

### Creating the difference variable to check the normality assumption

From the SPSS menus:

* Go to **Transform** → **Compute Variable**
* In the **Target Variable** box give the new variable a name, let's say `GHQ_Change`
* In the **Numeric Expression** box we will put the equation that gives the difference between the GHQ 3 months and GHQ baseline: `GHQ3months` - `GHQ12base`
* Click OK

You should now have a new variable in your dataset that is the difference made over the 3 months.

### Checking the normality assumption

From the SPSS menu:

* Go to **Analyze** → **Descriptive Statistics** → **Explore**
* Press the **Reset** button to remove previous work
* Place the `GHQ_Change` variable into the **Dependent List** box
* Click the **Plots** button and choose **Histogram** and **Normality plots with tests**
* Click **Continue**
* Click **OK**

### Checking the normality assumption output

Look for the table titled **Tests of Normality**.

You should note that the *p*-value for the **Shapiro-Wilk** test is 0.165.  Since this is greater than the cut-off of 0.05, we are **not going to reject normality**, and so assume our differences data are normally distributed.

We can therefore proced with the **paired-samples t-test**.

### Paired-samples t-test

From the SPSS menu:

* **Analyze** → **Compare Means...** → **Paired-Samples T Test**
* Place the two GHQ variables into the **Paired Variables** box, they should appear next to each other
* Click **OK**

</div>

<div class="output" markdown="1">

### Output

We can report the **t-statistic** (with the **degrees of freedom** in brakets afterwards) and the ***p*-value**.  This will be in the **Paired Samples Test** table. 

You should find that:

$$t(49)=0.307, p=0.760$$

*note* We have used the **Two-sided *p***.

You should also see that the mean difference between baseline and 3 months was 0.12, with the 3 month value being the lower amount (this can be seen from the **Paired Samples Statistics** table).
A lower amount shows on average there was some improvement in results over the time.

The 95% confidence interval for the difference made is -0.664 to 0.904, so you can see that no difference (0) is in the confidence interval range.

The **effect size** used is **Cohen's d**, and here you have $d=0.043$. (look at **Point Estimate**. The size of the effect can be interpreted using the guidelines:

|d|effect|
|:------|:------|
|0.2|small|
|0.5|medium|
|0.8|large|

</div>

### Findings

Since the $p$-value is not below the cut-off of 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and say that there has been a difference over the 3-months.

This is backed up by the 95% confidence interval containing 0, indicating no difference made.

The size of the improvement would be considered very small, using the guidelines for Cohen's d


### Write-up

A paired-samples t-test was carried out to test whether individuals GHQ12 score changed after a 3-month course, from baseline (Mean = 4.72, SD = 3.98) to the 3-month reading (Mean = 4.84, SD = 3.72).

There was a very small and not significant change in score between the two time points ($t(49)=0.307, p=0.760$, $d=0.043$ mean difference = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.664, 0.904]).

We do not have evidence that the 3-month period changed users GHQ12 score.
