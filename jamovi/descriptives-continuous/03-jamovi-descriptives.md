## Getting Descriptive Statistics
From the data set you are going to find the following descriptive statistics for the age of participants:

- Mean
- Median
- Standard Deviation
- Minimum Age
- Maximum Age
- Range
- 25h Percentile
- 75th Percentile
- Inter-quartile Range

</div>

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">
  
* From the top ribbon click on **Exploration** then choose **Descriptives**
* Place the `Age` variable into the **Variables** box

The dropdown next to **Descriptives** is set to **Variables across columns** and can be changed to **Variables across rows**.  This alters the way in which the output table is displayed, and is personal preference.

This should give you some of the descriptive statistics regarding the age of the participants that we are looking for.

* Click to expand the block called **Statistics**
* Tick the boxes for **Percentiles**, **Range**, and **IQR** (inter-quartile range)
