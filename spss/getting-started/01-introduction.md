## The SPSS Interface

When first opening SPSS you will be presented with a dialog which allows you to open recent files or start a new data file.  For this section, create a **new** file.

When opening SPSS you will be presented with something that looks like a standard spreadsheet.  There are two main parts to the data interface, the **Data View** and the **Variable View**

The **Data View** part stores your data. It is stored so that every row represents a participant and each column is a different piece of information for the participant, called a variable (e.g. name, age, height, etc.).

As well as entering the data you need to let jamovi know what type of data each variable is.  This is done in the **Variable View** tab.

When generating statistics with SPSS a new window will appear, the **Output Window**.
