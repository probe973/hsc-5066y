## Entering Your Data

1.  Click on the **Data View** tab in the bottom of SPSS. You should see the variables set-up as column names.

2.  You can now enter data directly into the spreadsheet. Each row represents a different person, and each column is one of the variables you have set up.

3.  Ask a few people around you for their details, or simply invent some data for some fictional participants.

4.  Enter the data as follows:
    *   For the **County** variable, type the name of a county (e.g., `Norfolk`).
    *   For the **Hand** variable, type either `1` or `2`. You can use the button in the top ribbon that looks like a road sign (with A and 1 on) to toggle between numerical and character appearance.
    *   For the **Beatles** variable, enter a number between `1` and `4`.
    *   For the **Height** variable, enter a number representing height in centimetres.

After entering a few rows of data, your spreadsheet might look something like this:
