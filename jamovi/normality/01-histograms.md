## Histograms
  
  A **histogram** is a chart for continuous variables.  Values for the measure are put into small groups (1 to 5, 5 to 9, etc) and then bars are drawn to show how many people (or whatever the participants represent) belong to that group.
  They are useful in showing the shape of the distribution, shows where the **mode** is (or are if there are more than one) and whether there are any extreme values that may **skew** results.

### Normal Distribution

  A **normally distributed** variable has a *bell like shape*.  It is symmetrical about the **mean** with a sinlge **mode** at the mean.  Due to the symmetry, the **median** is also the mean value.  
  An example of a histogram which could be considered normally distributed is shown below.

### Skew

  If a distribution has some values that are much smaller than the rest of the distribution, or much larger than the rest of the distribution, this is known as **skew**. 
  Skew can have an effect of distorting the **mean** from being a *good* indication of central tendency.

  Having values that are lower than the bulk of the data will have the effect of making the mean smaller, and you will find in such a distribution that the **mean will be smaller than the median**.  The histogram will 
  have a **tail to the left**.  This type of skew is called a **negative skew** or a **left skew**.

  Having values that are higher than the bulk of the data will have the effect of making the mean larger, and you will find in such a distribution that the **mean will be greater than the median**.  The histogram will 
  have a **tail to the right**.  This type of skew is called a **positive skew** or a **right skew**.

  Reporting the mean may not be appropriate when data are skewed, and the median may be a better choice.  The calculation of standard deviation, as a measure of dispersion, makes use of the mean, so this may also not be 
  the best measure; the inter-quartile range may be a better choice.

  Many statisical tests rely on assumptions about **parameters** such as the **mean** and **standard deviation**.  These type of tests are known as **parametric tests**.  It is important that we know whether data 
  is normally distributed, for both reporting purposes and for choosing the correct statistical model.
