# Software Review

This workshop gives you a chance to use your software of choice to practise generating statistics and carrying out tests on a data set.

You can download the dataset <a href="ebp.sav">here.</a>

</div>

<div class="explanation" markdown="1">

The file contains information about 150 fictitious patients.  For each patient there is a recording of:

* `Age` - measured in years
* `Systolic` - the patient's systolic blood pressure
* `Diastolic` - the patient's diastolic blood pressure
* `HospitalDays` -  the length of stay, in days, the patient stayed in hospital.
* `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, `k4` - 4 different measurements that measure how wobbly someone's knees are
* `Knees` - the total of the `k1` to `k4` variables
* `PreCNH`, `PostCNH` - a measurement of a patient's level of chronic nose hair at two different periods
* `Treatment` - whether a patient recieved treatment for chronic nose hair (0 = no, 1 = yes)

</div>

### Descriptive Statistics

You are to find the following statistics for the 150 patients **age**:
* mean
* median
* minimum
* maximum
* skew

You also need to create a **histogram** of the age data.

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### SPSS starting point
Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Explore

The histogram can be found in the **Plots** section

### jamovi starting point
Analyses → Exploration → Descriptives

The histogram can be found in the **Plots** dropdown

</div>

    question_text="What is the mean age, correct to 1 decimal point?"
    correct_answer="45.2"

    question_text="Comment on the shape of the histogram"
    solution_text="The histogram is not quite a normal shape as there some higher ages that are causing a positive skew to the shape (i.e. a tail to the right)"
%}

Repeat the descriptive statistics for the **Systolic Blood Pressure**.

{% include question_dropdown.html
    id="sw_systolic"
    title="Systolic blood pressure"
    question_text="What are the descriptive statistics and shape of the histogram for systolic blood pressure?"
    solution_text="
*   Mean = 130
*   Median = 130
*   Minimum = 101
*   Maximum = 155
*   Skew = -0.235
*   The histogram is fairly symettrical, but there is a slight negative skew with a peak in the graph to the right of the median value
    "

### Comparing Two Variables

In this section you will practice using software to:
* create a scatter diagram between two continuous variables
* determine, using normality assumptions, which correlation coefficients can be used to assess the association between the variables
* generate a correlation coefficient
* interpret the result of a correlation coefficient

You are going to look for a relationship between **systolic** and **diastolic** blood pressure readings.

Create a scatter diagram to compare **systolic** and **diastolic** blood pressure readings.

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### SPSS starting point

Graphs → Scatter/Dot
Choose the **Simple Scatter**

### jamovi starting point

Analyses → Exploration → Scatterplot

</div>

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_scatter_sys_dia"
    title="Correlation"
    question_text="From the scatter plot, does there appear to be any correlation between the two variables?"
    options="no::No, there does not appear to be any correlation||ng::There appears to be a negative correlation||ps::There appears to be a positive correlation"
    correct_answer="ps"
    solution_text="Higher systolic blood pressure seems be associated with higher diastolic blood pressure, so **positive correlation**"
%}

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_which_coeff_sys_dia"
    title="Which correlation coefficient"
    question_text="Given that both variables can be assumed to be **normally distributed**, which correlation coefficient should be used to quantify the level of correlation?"
    options="pn::Pearson's Correlation Coefficient||sp::Spearman's Correlation Coefficient"
    correct_answer="pn"
    solution_text="As data are normal, you should use the **parametric** correlation coefficient: **Pearson's**"
%}

Use your software to calculate the **correlation** coefficient.

<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### SPSS starting point

Analyze → Correlate → Bivariate

### jamovi starting point

Analyses → Regression → Correlation Matrix

</div>

{% include question_numerical.html
    id="sw_sys_dia_cc"
    title="Correlation Coefficient Value"
    question_text="What is value of the correlation coefficient, correct to 3 decimal places?"
    correct_answer="0.839"
    tolerance="0.05"
    solution_text="Skewness from output table"
%}

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_sys_dia_cc_int"
    title="Interpretation"
    question_text="Which of the options best describes the correlation?"
    options="sn::There is a strong negative correlation||wn::There is a weak negative correlation||sp::There is a strong positive correlation||wp::There is a weak positive correlation"
    correct_answer="sp"
    solution_text="A correlation coefficient of 0.839 would be considered strong positive correlation."
%}

### Reliability of Measures

The **knobbly knees** measurement is calculated from 4 sub measures (`k1` to `k4').

A **Cronbach alpha** of the 4 measurements is found to be $\alpha = 0.913$.

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_knee_alpha"
    title="Cronbach interpretation"
    question_text="How would you interpret this value of Cronbach's alpha"
    options="w::It shows poor levels of consistency in the subscales||m::It shows moderate levels of consistency in the subscales||s::It shows strong levels of consistency in the subscales"
    correct_answer="s"
    solution_text="A Cronbach alpha is between 0 and 1, with higher numbers representing better consistency.  Such a high value would be considered a strong level consistency."
%}

### Comparing Groups

You wish to explore how effective the chronic nose hair treatment program was.  The `Treatment` variable shows whether the patient was part of a treatment group or not.

To do this you are going to carry out a statistical test to see if there is a significant difference between the `PostCNH` variable (chronic nose hair after treatment) between the treatment group and the non-treatment group.

Before performing this analysis, you carry out a statistical test to see if there is a significant difference between these two groups on the `PreCNH` variable.

{% include question_dropdown.html
    id="sw_precnh_treat_why"
    title="Comparing before the treatment"
    question_text="Why should you explore if there is any difference between the groups before the start of the experiment period?"
    solution_text="If you find a difference between the two groups after the treatment, it may be because of the treatment or it may be because the two groups were different before the start of the experiment.  You are trying to establish that the two groups were not too disimilar in chronic nose hair before treatment/non-treatmen began"
%}

The following statistics are derived from the `PreCNH` variable:

| Treatment | N | Mean | Median | SD | Shapiro-Wilk p |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| No Treatment | 80 | 28.6 | 29.5 | 7.71 | 0.199 |
| Treatment | 70 | 28.7 | 29 | 8.27 | 0.084 |

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_precnh_cm"
    title="Comparing means"
    question_text="Do the descriptive statistics appear to show any major difference in the two groups mean values?"
    options="no::The two groups look quite similar||yes::The two groups look very different"
    correct_answer="no"
    solution_text="The mean CNH values of 28.6 and 28.7 do not suggest any major differences"
%}

{% include question_multiple_choice.html
    id="sw_precnh_norm"
    title="Normality"
    question_text="Are the p-values for the Shapiro-Wilk test significant, and should we therefore use a Mann-Whitney U test instead of an independent-samples t-test?"
    options="no::Both p-values are over 0.05, so use an independent-samples t-test to compare||yes::At least one p-value is below 0.05, so cannot assume normality, so use Mann-Whitney U test"
    correct_answer="no"
    solution_text="Both p-values are above the 0.05 threshold."
%}

You are going to use an **indepedendent-samples t-test** to determine whether there is a significant difference between the treatment and the non-treatment group at the pre experiment stage.

You will also need to check the **homogeneity of variances** using a variance test such as the **Levene test**.


<div class="instructions" markdown="1">

### SPSS starting point

Analyze →  Compare Means → Independent-samples T test
Remember also to use the **Define Groups** button and enter **0** and **1** in as the groups

### jamovi starting point

Analyses → T-Tests → Independent Samples T-Test
Ensure that the **Homogeneity Test** is checked
