## Scatter Diagrams

A **scatter diagram** is a visual representation of pairs of scores on two measured variables.  For each individual you plot their score on variable against their score on the other variable in a two-dimensional x-y plot.

Using the scatter diagram you can observe if there is any relationship between the two variables:
* If you observe that people who score high on variable 1 also tend to score on high on variable 2, this would be referred to as **positive correlation**
* If you observe that people who score high on variable 1 tend to score low on variable 2, this would be referred to as **negative correlation**
* If you observe no pattern, this would be referred to as **no correlation**

### SPSS scatter diagram age and ARAT at 3 months

You are going to see if there is an association with users age and their ARAT score after 3 months.

* From the jamovi menu go to **Graphs** → **Scatter/Dot**
* Choose **Simple Scatter** and click **Define**
* Place `Age` in the **X-Axis** box
* Place `ARAT3month` in the **Y-Axis** box
* Click **OK**

</div>

![Scatter diagram with age on the x-axis and ARAT 3 month on the y-axis.  There appears to be a downward trend, with higher age resulting in lower ARAT]({{ "/assets/images/scatter-age-ARAT3.png" | relative_url }})

The trend appears to be that as age increases the ARAT score decreases.  This would be referred to as **negative correlation**.

### SPSS scatter diagram ARAT baseline and Barthel baseline

You are going to see if there is an association with users age and their ARAT score after 3 months.

* From the jamovi menu go to **Graphs** → **Scatter/Dot**
* Choose **Simple Scatter** and click **Define**
* Click **Reset** to clear previous work
* Place `Age` in the **X-Axis** box
* Place `ARAT3month` in the **Y-Axis** box
* Click **OK**

</div>

![Scatter diagram with ARAT base on the x-axis and Barthel base on the y-axis.  There appears to be an upward trend, with higher ARAT resulting in higher Barthel]({{ "/assets/images/scatter-ARAT-Barthel.png" | relative_url }})

The trend appears to be that as ARAT increases the Barthel score increases.  This would be referred to as **positive correlation**.

Create scatter diagrams of other variables and decide on the correlation.
