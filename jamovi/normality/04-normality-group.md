## Using jamovi to check normality for different groups

In order to check whether the `age` variable is normally distributed for all groups in the `sex` variable, we need to make use of the **Split by** box in the jamovi **Descriptives** dialog.

Either or go to the analysis you previously did for `age` and add the `sex` variable to the **Split by** box or create a fresh output:

* Go to Analyses → Exploration → Descriptives
* Place `age` into the **Variables** box
* Place `sex` into the **Split by** box
* From the **Statistics** section check **Shapiro-Wilk**
* From the **Plots** section check **Histogram**

</div>

<div class="output" markdown="1">

Things you should note here:

|Statistic|Mean|Median|Shapiro-Wilk, W|Shapiro-Wilk, p|
|-------|------|------|------|------|
|Age Male|67.3|68|0.980|0.928|
|Age Female|67.1|67.5|0.973|0.612|

The shape of the histograms created.

The histograms in jamovi, when using the **Split by** button, well they're a bit naff.  For better histograms:

* Go to Analyses → JJStatsPlot → Histogram
* Place `Age` into the **Variables** box
* Place `Sex` into the **Split By** box
* For clarity here, uncheck the **Statistical Results** from the **Plot** block.

You should now see histograms for the different groups, as well as one for the entire sample.

  For both sexes here, you should see that their means and medians are similar.

  You should see that the histograms have a *normal* type shape.

  You should see that the **Shapiro-Wilk** test returned *p*-values that were not less than 0.05, indicating that the distributions were normal.
