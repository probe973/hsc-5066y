## Box Plots
**Box plots** are a graphical way to show average and spread of data.  They plot key descriptive statistics and join them into a box and whisker shape.

The points that are shown are:
- Minimum
- 25th Percentile
- 50th Percentile (Median)
- 75th Percentile
- Maximum

Points which are considered **outliers** (not fitting with the rest of the data) are often plotted seperately outside of the box plot.  These can be above or below the maximum/minimum.
Sometimes you will also see the **mean** plotted on the box plot.

As part of the **Explore** output, you should see a box plot for age.

The numbers next to the outliers are the row numbers in the SPSS dataset.  So the participants that are in the rows that are shown can be considered outliers.
