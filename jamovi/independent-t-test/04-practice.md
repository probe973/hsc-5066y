## Comparing Scores Between Two Groups

In these data you have ARAT, Barthel. FAST, and GHQ12 at baseline and follow-up.  You also have the sex and the side of CVA as grouping variables, containing two groups.

Perform a series of tests of difference on these variables and for a grouping variable.  You need to choose between the **Student's t-test**, **Welch t-test**, and **Mann-Whitney U test**. So,

* check the normality of the measured variable for both groups of interest
* use normality to determine whether to use t-test or Mann-Whitney
* if using a t-test, use homogeneity of variance test to determine whether it should be Student or Welch.

Have fun.
